        I'm a developer with a solid grip on both frontend and backend
        technologies. I'm comfortable working with languages like JavaScript,
        Python, and Go, and have experience using frameworks like React,
        Next.js, and Django. My work ranges from building dynamic web
        applications to developing efficient backend servers. I'm always eager
        to learn and expand my skills, whether it's picking up a new programming
        language or diving into low-level assembly code. I enjoy problem-solving
        and bringing creative, effective solutions to the projects I work on.
